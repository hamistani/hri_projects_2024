1. What happens when you close one or the other?
If I close listener before I close talker, the talker still talks, whereas if I close talker first,
listener doesn't print anything, and waits for talker to talk. 

2. What happens when you close the core node?
When I close the core mode, there is no longer a connection. In other words, the connection is refused. 

3. What happens when you change the rate for the talker?
    default is 10 
    rate = 1
    rate = 100
    rate = 100000
    rate = 0.1
    rate = 0.001

It speeds up or slows down how fast the talker talks. 

4. What happens when you start two talker nodes?
The listener picks up both talker nodes. 

5. What happens when you start two listner nodes?
Both listeners hears the talker.
